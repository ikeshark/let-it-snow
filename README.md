# Let it snow

Project uses CSS variables and animations to create an interactive celebration of the snowy season.

## Snowperson

Snowperson bounces, waves, and moves left or right. CSS variables are used to move the snowperson after the animation has resolved. The increment variable determines how far the snowperson moves.

## Snowflakes

Snowflakes are divided into three groups, each group of snowflakes moves slower, has a smaller size, and has a darker color. In order to give a more organic feel, the animation delays are shuffled with javascript.
